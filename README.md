# Personal-Website
This is my personal website's GitHub repository. It is a simple HTML-based website with a clean and minimal design that focuses on the content. The website highlights my skills, experiences, and projects, and it includes a "Contact Me" section where visitors can send me an email or connect with me on social media.
